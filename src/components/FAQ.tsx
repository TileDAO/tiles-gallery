          <p>
            Tiles are created by a server located at https://api.tiles.art. Tile
            images are rendered each time a url like https://api.tiles.art/tile/

          <p>
            A server is used because, unlike NFT projects with a finite number
            of artworks in a collection, it would be impossible to pre-generate
            and store every Tile on a network like IPFS. While Tiles could be
            generated and stored at the time of minting, saving a{' '}

            </a>{' '}
            in the on-chain metadata, this is risky: in the case of an
            unexpected network or browser error, flawed metadata could be stored
            and an incorrect CID would be irreversibly saved on-chain for that
            Tile.

          <p>
            If needed, the server could be relocated in the future, or
            redesigned in a case like the ETH wallet address standard being
            changed. The Tiles contract can be updated to retrieve
            metadata/image URIs from the new location using the{' '}
            <code>setBaseURI()</code> function.

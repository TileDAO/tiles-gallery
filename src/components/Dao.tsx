        <h3>TileDAO</h3>
        <p>Above all else, art is a pillar of community.</p>
        <p>
          TileDAO exists to enable a community to collectively decide how Tiles,
          as well as the funds raised from selling them, are put to use. Because
          the supply of Tiles is virtually infinite, they may continue to sell,
          well... forever. This is an effort to use a potentially infinite
          revenue stream in the coolest way possible.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Funding</h4>
        <p>
          All revenue from Tile sales are sent to the TileDAO wallet, a{' '}
          <a href="https://juicebox.money">Juicebox</a> treasury that makes all
          outflows programmable and transparent, and rewards everyone who
          purchases Tiles with a balance of <b>$TILE ERC-20 tokens</b>{' '}
          proportional to the amount they've spent. As described in the{' '}
          <a href="/#/manifesto">manifesto</a>, it will be up to the community
          to decide how the treasury funds are put to use.

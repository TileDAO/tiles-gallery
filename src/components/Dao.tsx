        <h3>TileDAO</h3>
        <p>
          A creative renaissance is underway. Tools and platforms are actively
          being built—from within the crypto world and beyond—that are changing
          the distribution of content in favor of artists. Middle-men like
          streaming platforms and social networks who make content available as
          cheaply as possible, while leaving creators few other options for
          gaining exposure, are being replaced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, we're reminding ourselves that content creation is
          first class labor, and that artists should be paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          TileDAO itself is created and funded out of art. Its goal is to fund
          projects that are building a more sustainable and equitable creators'
          economy, along with the artists who will make it worth it.

        <h4>Funding</h4>
        <p>
          All revenue from Tile sales are sent to the TileDAO wallet, a{' '}
          <a href="https://juice.work">Juice</a> treasury that makes all
          outflows programmable and transparent, and rewards everyone who
          purchases Tiles with a balance of <b>TILE ERC-20 tokens</b>{' '}
          proportional to the amount they've spent. As described in the{' '}
          <a href="/#/manifesto">manifesto</a>, it will be up to the community
          to decide how the treasury funds are put to use.

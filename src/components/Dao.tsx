        <p>
          TileDAO exists to fund the community that will shape the future of
          Tiles. Because Tiles supply is virtually limitless, their primary sale
          may continue indefinitely. This DAO is an effort to use a potentially
          infinite revenue stream in the coolest way possible.

          treasury where all spending is programmable and transparent, and which
          rewards everyone who purchases Tiles with a balance of TILE ERC-20
          tokens proportional to the amount they've spent. As described in the{' '}

          To begin with, the only spending allocations made will be to support
          the Tile artist and the Juicebox platform. At any time, a portion of
          all unallocated funds can be claimed in exchange for burning TILE.

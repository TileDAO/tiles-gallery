        <h3>TileDAO</h3>
        <p>Above all else, art is a pillar of community.</p>
        <p>
          TileDAO exists to enable the community that will shape the future of
          Tiles. Because their supply is virtually infinite, they may continue
          to sell, well... forever. This is an effort to use a potentially
          infinite revenue stream in the coolest way possible.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Funding</h4>
        <p>
          All revenue from Tile sales are sent to the TileDAO wallet, a{' '}
          <a href="https://juicebox.money">Juicebox</a> treasury that makes all
          outflows programmable and transparent, and rewards everyone who
          purchases Tiles with a balance of <b>$TILE ERC-20 tokens</b>{' '}
          proportional to the amount they've spent. As described in the{' '}
          <a href="/#/manifesto">manifesto</a>, it will be up to the community
          to decide how the treasury funds are put to use. To begin with, the
          only allocation will be to support the Tile Artist.

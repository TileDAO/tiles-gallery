          Tiles is the first art project of its kind: a virtually infinite
          collection of generated artworks (16^40 in total). Each one is created
          from a different ETH address. Each one is unique.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mathematically, all Tiles are equally rare. All are born from the same
          assortment of simple shapes and colors—each assembled in its own
          fashion. In that way, Tiles are a bit like us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tiles will continue to sell forever. Maybe they'll be sought after by
          owners of matching addresses to decorate their ENS handles. Maybe
          their value will become "pegged" to the final price floor of 2.56 ETH,
          and they'll be traded as currency. Or perhaps the future will write a
          more interesting story for them altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as Tiles continue to sell, the revenue will be sent to the{' '}
          <a href="/#/dao">TileDAO</a> treasury to be redistributed with the
          guidance of anyone who owns a Tile.

          Tiles is an experiment. And like any good experiment, part of what
          makes it beautiful is that its role in the world can't be predicted—it
          will only ever be as interesting, influential, or valuable as humans
          like you or I make it.

        <p>Thank you for being a part of it.</p>

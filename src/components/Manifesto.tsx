        <h3>Manifesto</h3>
        <p>
          Humanity is most simply defined by our desire to form communities
          around ideas, symbols of those ideas, and artifacts that satisfy our
          overlapping interpretations of beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tiles are a celebration of what gives meaning to those communities:
          the individual. There is one Tile generated for every possible ETH
          wallet address—each representing a unique identity in the
          decentralized ecosystem that makes projects like this possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mathematically, all Tiles are equally rare. They are all fashioned
          from the same assortment of simple shapes and colors, but each in a
          unique way. In that sense, Tiles are a bit like us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Owning a Tile is an invitation to participate in the{' '}
          <a href="/#/dao">TileDAO</a>, which receives all revenue from the
          Tiles primary sale. Because the supply is virtually infinite, funding
          for the DAO may continue indefinitely—as long as Tiles are sold.
        </p>
        <p>
          How these funds are used will be Tiles' true creation of value. In the
          future, Tiles will be defined not only by the artwork that gives them
          shape, but by what we build from them together.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for being a part of it.</p>

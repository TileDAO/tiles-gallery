          Tiles is the first art project of its kind: a virtually infinite
          collection of generated artworks (16^40 in total). Each one is created
          from a different ETH address. Each one is unique.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mathematically, Tiles are equally rare. All are fashioned from the
          same assortment of simple shapes and colors, but assembled in their
          own way. In that way, Tiles are a bit like us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tiles will continue to sell forever. Maybe they'll be sought after by
          owners of matching wallets to decorate ENS handles. Maybe they'll be
          collected en masse to tile ceilings in the metaverse. Or perhaps the
          future will write a more interesting story for them altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Tiles do have one thing in common: each is an invitation for its
          owner to participate in a <a href="/#/dao">DAO</a> paid for by the
          never-ending Tiles primary sale. It'll be up to the community to
          decide what that means.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like any good experiment, the role of Tiles in the world can't be
          predictedâ€”it will only ever be as valuable, influential, or beautiful
          as we decide to make it.
